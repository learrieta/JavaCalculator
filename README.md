# Overview
 This software is written in Java. It is a simple Calculator that can do basic mathematical operations such addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. It was originally going to be a terminal use only
but upon having it finished relatively soon, I went ahead and create a user interface for it which made it look better.

The main purpose for this software is to reinforce my knowledge of Java and improve upon my foundations on this programming language. I also wanted to experiment with
some user interface library that this language provides.
